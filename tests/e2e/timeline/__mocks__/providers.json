These data are collected as part of broad-scale inventories and complement remote sensing images. At the other extreme, some data sets contain a large number of variables, representing the dynamics of important biogeochemical processes, measured for a limited period (from seasons to years) in a few locations (intensive field campaign data).  \nThe data at the DAAC are useful for developing and improving process-based models of biogeochemical dynamics, for verifying classifications based on remotely sensed information, and for validating ecosystem model outputs. Integration of these data is important to understand and project how Earth systems function. By linking data about climate, atmospheric trace gases, and biological processes, we can better understand how global changes may impact ecosystems.
